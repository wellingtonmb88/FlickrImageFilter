Cousera Project : iOS App Development with Swift 

The third course of the iOS App Development with Swift specialization I developed foundational programming skills 
to support graphical element presentation and data manipulation from basic functions through to advanced processing as follows:

Camera, photo library, view presentation and the delegate pattern: I'm able to access the camera and photo library by presenting an image picker and understanding how to get the image through the delegate.

Core Graphics: I'm able to apply use of Core Graphics to access the internals of an image and perform pixel manipulations.

Touch handling and gestures: I'm able to use a pan gesture so to change the brightness of an image by swiping vertically on it.

Animations and Transitions: I'm able to animate the transition of the image in a view along with the position and size.

Alerts and Action Sheets: I implemented alert functionality to prompt users about important actions. 

Advanced algorithms and threading: Perform more advanced image processing and use background threads to prevent blocking the main thread.
